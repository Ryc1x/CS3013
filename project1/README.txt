# Summary of Work
This is a check point submission of our project 1.

Currently we have v0 completed, and started on v1.
To run v0, use commands:
	cd v0
	make
	./mc0
Similarly for v1:
	cd v1
	make
	./mc1

For v1, we just started it and we just have commands: 0, 1, 
2, and e finished. (And also fixed a minor input bug in v0)

For both parts, we have limited the input to 128 chars, and 
32 individual arguments (for ls)

The "input" file in each folder are just our test inputs for 
our program, you can use it by:
	./mc1(or mc0) < input

Thanks!
