# INSTRUCTIONS
To run the program, do:
    $ make
then:
    $ ./pan [# teams] [# pirates] [# ninjas] [avg. P custuming] 
        [avg. N custuming] [avg. P arrival] [avg. N arrival] 
        [(optional) custom stddev] [(optional) arrival stddev]

* The last 2 arguments is for controlling the deviation of result generated by 
  our random distribution, which both have default value scale = 1.
  The deviation is smaller with smaller value, larger with larger value. 

# DESCRIPTION

In this question, we implemented a queue that record the arrival time of the actors, 
then use several semaphore to allow only desired actors to get in.

Our streategy is:
 - who comes first at the beginning claim the "turn" = (PIRATE/NINJA).
 - for any actor(threads), they can enter the building if:
   1. there is no opponent in the building
   2. there is available spot in the building
   3. either:
     (a) ally hold the "turn" and thread is the first in queue amongst allies, OR
     (b) the thread is the first in entire queue
 - "turn" will be swapped if n consecutive NINJA/PIRATE goes into the shop, where 
   n is the number of customing teams.

Once they satisfies the requirement, they can get in the building. And our testing 
results shows that this streategy can effectively reduce the starving time and allow 
more concurrency.



# TESTING
An sample testing is written below:
Here we use print to mark the status of threads:
 - on the way! ([time])
 - arrives!
 - is customing! ([time])
 - leaving!
 - will come again!

From the results below we could see that they can't get in to the building at the 
same time. When Ninja are customing, pirates will wait for them (vice versa).

From the final statistics, we could see that the individual starving time is really 
short (usually under 10 sec). So our implementation can efficiently customing the 
pirates and ninjas, which maximizes the profit.
